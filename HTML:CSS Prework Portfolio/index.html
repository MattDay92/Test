                <p>After graduating from Indiana University, I began work on composing my first musical, Paper Swords, which was an award winner at the 2020 Chicago Musical Theatre Festival.  My other work includes Make Me A Match (Allen & Gray New Voices Concert Series, IndyFringe 2019 Audience Choice Award Winner), 
                    Boy Meets Musical, and a few other projects still in early development.  I recently released my first album, Different Lens, containing songs from Paper Swords and Make Me A Match and featuring performances by some of my closest friends.</p>

                <h1>Why?</h1>
                <strong></strong>
                <p>Why am I joining this class?  Although I've been very fulfilled in my career as a teacher, I'm looking for something new.  
                    Ever since the pandemic hit, I've felt a little underappreciated in my job by both students and administration.  So, although 
                    I will missing working with kids, I'm ready for a fresh start.
